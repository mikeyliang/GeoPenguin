## Problem

<br>

Forgetfulness is a well-known issue among not only aging adults, but also college students. According to a research study carried out by National-Lottery.co.uk, 15 million United Kingdom Citizens, or 50% of UK’s population, will leave a cup of tea to go cold or forget where they put the keys to their house or car. Furthermore, the onslaught of COVID-19 has placed the utmost importance on wearing masks. A UNC survey https://www.unc.edu/posts/2020/07/14/student-survey-examines-public-health-attitudes/ reveals that 28% of the students say they are extremely or somewhat likely to go to parties or other large campus gatherings and 24% of those students in an undergraduate program say they are “somewhat likely” to wear a mask. Not surprisingly, a large number of students who “will likely wear a mask”, will likely forget to wear one. Given the importance of taking safety precautions amidst the coronavirus pandemic, curbing the problem of forgetfulness is now more important than ever. The combination of forgetfulness and importance of staying cautious from the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, is, will, or can cause additional outbreaks, personal danger, and other unpleasant effects on the community.  


<br>

In observation of the current reminder apps currently on the market, the Reminders App on IOS has issues and others don't tailor their reminder apps for specifically students. One of the main features they have is the Remind me at a Location; however, the drawback is the leaving/arriving reminder only works if you are driving a car. A Survey done by 214 National Universities reported that 46.8 percent of all students drive a car on/to campus (https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2018-03-06/11-national-universities-where-students-rarely-bring-cars#:~:text=Among%20the%20214%20National%20Universities,to%20have%20cars%20on%20campus.). This is less than the majority. By default, the rest of the students travel to school primarily by walking, biking, or taking a bus. 


<br>

## Solution

<br>

This is where GeoPenguin can help and promisingly reduce the rates of daily coronavirus infections. Our solution, GeoPenguin, is a healthcare and reminder application that emphasizes a default list of health reminders (during a pandemic) as well as personal supplies you don’t want to forget through an efficient and simple notification system. Along with some geofencing and basic distance calculations, GeoPenguin can detect if a student is leaving their primary housing residence and remind them if they’ve forgotten anything they have written on the list. GeoPenguin’s functionalities sum up to tailor some of the problems students have on a day to day basis: forgetfulness, the cautious environment caused by the pandemic, and the inaccessibility to use a car on Campus to access the location feature on the IOS Reminder App.

<br>

## Underlying Technologies

<br>

GeoPenguin’s proprietary design was drawn using both Adobe Illustrator and Figma, a collaborative design/drawing environment. With the help of these two applications, the team at GeoPenguin was able to first, design the overall penguin, next, the penguin logo, after, the design of the app, and lastly, use “apply mockups” to show what our design would look like on the iPhone. GeoPenguin’s IOS Platform is built using SwiftUI for the frontend design and Swift for the backend to store data locally. The SwiftUI design code consisted of mainly font and image imports, HStacks, ZStacks, VStacks, Rectangles, and some custom Modifiers and Functions.

On the other hand, the Swift backend consisted of Apple/XCode’s MapKit to apply geofencing and Arrays to store user data locally on the app itself.

## Addressing Concerns

<br>

While there exist some concerns over privacy, data protection, and user security, GeoPenguin will be implementing and designing security measures to integrate. These measures will mainly incorporate home addresses being stored in a secure cloud database and not on individual users’ devices. This prevents lower-level problems such as social media toxicity, bad reviews, and privacy breaches/problems. 

<br>

## Future Aspirations

<br>

In the future, the GeoPenguin team will continue to improve the notification system and the accuracy of the geofencing calculations done in the backend. Also, the team plans to add personalization for the user on the settings portion of the app. For example, this would include an option to choose a notification style, options to go into dark mode, activation of voice command siri to read the list of reminders, and other cool features that would ultimately improve the app’s quality of life.
