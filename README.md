## Problem

<br>

Forgetfulness is a well-known issue among not only aging adults, but also college students. According to a research study carried out by National-Lottery.co.uk, 15 million United Kingdom Citizens, or 50% of UK’s population, will leave a cup of tea to go cold today or forget where they put the keys to their house or car (Exhibit 1). Furthermore, the onslaught of COVID-19 has placed the utmost importance on wearing masks. A UNC survey https://www.unc.edu/posts/2020/07/14/student-survey-examines-public-health-attitudes/ revealsthat 28% of the students say they are extremely or somewhat likely to go to parties or other large campus gatherings and 24% of those students in an undergraduate program say they are “somewhat likely” to wear a mask (Exhibit 2). Not surprisingly, a large number of students who “will likely wear a mask”, will likely forget to wear one. Given the importance of taking safety precautions amidst the coronavirus pandemic, curbing the problem of forgetfulness is now more important than ever. The combination of forgetfulness and importance of staying cautious from the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, is, will, or can cause additional outbreaks, personal danger, and other unpleasant effects on the community.

In observation of the current reminder apps currently on the market, the Reminders App on IOS has issues that don’t tailor their reminder apps for specifically students. On of the main features they have is the Remind me at a Location, however, the drawback is the leaving/arriving reminder only works if you are driving a car. A Survey done by 214 National Universities reported that 46.8 percent of all students drive a car on/to campus (https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2018-03-06/11-national-universities-where-students-rarely-bring-cars#:~:text=Among%20the%20214%20National%20Universities,to%20have%20cars%20on%20campus.). This is less than the majority. By default, the rest of the students travel to school primarily by walking, biking, or taking a bus.
